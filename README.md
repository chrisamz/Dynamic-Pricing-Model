# Dynamic Pricing Models

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices in real-time based on demand, competition, and other factors. Dynamic pricing, also known as surge pricing or time-based pricing, allows businesses to optimize their pricing strategy to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates skills in reinforcement learning, time series forecasting, demand estimation, and pricing strategies.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to sales, demand, competition prices, and other relevant factors. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Historical sales data, competitor pricing data, market trends, external factors (e.g., holidays, events).
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature engineering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors affecting demand and pricing.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, correlation analysis.

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
Develop models to forecast future demand based on historical sales data and other relevant factors.

- **Techniques Used:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM networks.

### 4. Demand Estimation
Estimate the demand elasticity and understand how changes in price affect the quantity demanded.

- **Techniques Used:** Regression analysis, elasticity calculations.

### 5. Reinforcement Learning for Pricing
Implement a reinforcement learning model to adjust prices dynamically in real-time based on the observed demand and competition.

- **Techniques Used:** Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), policy gradient methods.

### 6. Pricing Strategies
Evaluate different pricing strategies and their impact on revenue and customer satisfaction.

- **Techniques Used:** Comparative analysis, A/B testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic_pricing_models.git
   cd dynamic_pricing_models
   
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### Data Preparation

1. Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    
### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
2. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess data, perform EDA, develop forecasting models, estimate demand, implement reinforcement learning, and evaluate pricing strategies:
